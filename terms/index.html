<p>Weâ€™re quite keen to protect your own rights to any contributions to
newsletters that you might make. As of such, all articles should be licensed
to The Argus under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 International license</a>.
This allows us to fine-tune your work, but ensures that you will always be
credited for any contribution that you have made.</p>

<p>If you wish to offer it under other terms, please get in touch. However, 
those terms will need to be comparable with the needs of the Argus to be
able to edit your work. It will also allow your work to be re-licensed to
others under the terms below. In cases where it is not licensed under a
variant of the CC BY-NC license, reasonable effort will be made to consult
you to agree suitable terms. If The Argus makes and financial gain by
re-licensing your work, a part of it will be paid to you. You may always
re-license your own work to others under different conditions.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-want-to-reuse-material">If you want to reuse material</h1>

<p>As standard, any issue of the Argus may be licensed under the terms
specified at the bottom of the issue. This will typically be a variant of
the CC BY-NC license (for example, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC 4.0 International License</a>).</p>

<p>This allows anything published in the Argus to be reworked and/or reused,
provided that it is not done for financial gain, and that the reused work is 
appropriately attributed.</p>

<p>The non-commerical clause may not suit your particular site; for example,
you may wish to reuse it on a site where the hosting is funded by online
advertisements, or you may wish to reuse some of the material in a
commerical publication. If this is the case, please get in touch. In most
circumstances a more permissive license will be granted. In some situations,
a small donation may be requested.</p>
