            <p>I'm on holiday this week, so haven't been able to trawl through the week's Subbuteo news. Don't worry - there'll be a full update next week - but in the meantime, here's an exclusive interview with incoming ASA president Chris Sweetland.</p>

<p>Part of a delegation of 8 players from the USA going to Italy for the World
Cup this September represents the culmination of a Subbuteo career lasting
for 42 years - with a large break in the middle - for incoming ASA president
Chris Sweetland.</p>

<p>A childhood friend who had returned to the Chicago from London brought the
game back with him. The pair played for hours every day, playing by an
improvised set of rules, isolated from the rest of the community. “We were
the only two players we were aware of in the area.”, says Chris, “We were
really not too aware of what was going on with the game in the United States
or internationally, and we really did not care.” The pair maintained
detailed statistics on every figure in on their team, publishing a sports
paper with colourful match reports.</p>

<p>Several years passed, by which time they had subscribed to a Subbuteo
newsletter, becoming aware of the popularity of the game overseas, although
they were unaware of anyone else in the area that played. Then, after
graduating from high school, Chris left for college, with the intention of
finishing his involvement with the game. “We would get together occasionally
and I would play with my two brothers but I put the game away for what I
thought was forever when I graduated high school”.</p>

<p>Then, two years ago, Chris returned. “I knocked around for about 2 months
before deciding to search the game on-line to find out what had become of
it”, he says. “I was almost sure, at the time, that the game had died a slow
death.”. Instead he found that not only was the same still going, but there
was some relatively local action too, with a group of players a three hour
drive away, in Michigan. There were also small groups throughout the
country, each with similar stories to his their own.</p>

<p>In a typically upbeat statement, Chris describes how the Chicago club that
he’d founded has blossomed: “Our club decided to host the 2015 ASA National
Tournament in August as a way to gain national visibility as a club that
wants to see the sport grow”. Within months he had become an active
organiser in the Midwest, becoming ASA Vice President for the region. He is
due to become ASA President in September this year.</p>

<p>He’s very positive, too, about the benefits that Twitter, Facebook, and
internet forums can bring: “Social media has been really good for the game. 
It allows us to see what is happening around the world in real-time. It 
really helped promote and keep the game vibrant in the United States as well
since there is such a large geographic divide between the active pockets of
Subbuteo players”. He also sees this as the future of the American game,
providing a way to bring younger players in to an association with an ageing
membership.</p>

<p>He’s no less enthusiastic about the role that FISTF, WASPA and the American
Subbuteo Association have played, continuing “I liked the fact that a
broadly accepted set of rule changes came out of this effort [by FISTF] 
recently many of which I think add to the enjoyment and playability of the
game.”</p>

<p>Whilst Chris classes himself as one of the less-abled players on the 
American circuit, he feels that he has become far more competitive since his 
return. “I refer to it more often these days as a sport rather than as a 
game.”, he says, “It encompasses real head to head heartfelt competition and 
thoughtful strategy. Don’t get me wrong, I always enjoyed scoring the 
winning goal against my childhood buddy, but, today it feels more like the 
competition I enjoyed in my college American football and baseball days.”</p>

<p>“What struck me when I was reintroducing myself to the sport and travelling 
throughout the Midwest was how much I enjoyed the people and the camaraderie 
they promote.  People here really enjoy being with each other at these 
tournament gatherings and want to see the sport grow.  I would liken many of 
these gatherings to those long weekends we sometimes have with buddies from 
our high school and college days who long since moved away.”</p>

<p>Finally, where will the game be in 30 years time? Chris is positive: “I 
actually think that it will grow as long as there is a continuing strong 
interest in football world-wide.” The link with football is key, Chris 
feels, along with an active recruitment effort for younger players via 
social media and on the ground by local clubs.</p>
