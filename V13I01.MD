Not content with celebrating their 35th year in existence, the FFFT appear to have also taken it upon themselves to beat FISTF in the international association's own announcements! Anyway, AS Hennuyer will be hosting. In French, but there's a link to a version in English (version en Anglais) at the bottom.
